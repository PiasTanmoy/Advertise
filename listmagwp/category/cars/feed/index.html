				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I jump onboard Emilia Motors&#8217; incredible Mansory Vivere, a custom built Bugatti Veyron made by Mansory with price tag of about $2.5m! Based on the Bugatti Veyron, the Vivere is completely bespoke and limited to 2 units in the world. Aside the aesthetic modifications, the Vivere now produces 1100hp thanks to an ECU modification and finally the W16 engine sounds much better with a full titanium exhaust! In the video you will get to see and hear the car with a series of revs and onboard footages!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli is the 3rd-generation of the model, but it&#8217;s been 17 years since the last one, and this new smaller Maserati comes only as a 4-door sedan. As with past Maseratis, the Ghibli is the clear sporting leader in this segment given its suspension settings and power delivery. The chassis architecture under the Ghibli sport sedan is also all-new and the drive performance is precise and enjoyable. For North America, the stylish Ghibli comes in two trims: the rear-drive Ghibli and the all-wheel-drive Ghibli S Q4. No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.</p>
<h4>Under the Hood:</h4>
<ul class="minus-gold-list">
<li>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (Ghibli for North America only)</li>
<li>345 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm</li>
<li>369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-5,000 rpm</li>
<li>EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing Notes:</h4>
<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli has a starting Manufacturer&#8217;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $67,000 for the rear-wheel-drive base model tuned specifically for North America to 345 horsepower. The top S Q4 all-wheel-drive version of the Maserati sedan starts near $77,000. Both trims come relatively loaded versus several of their competitors in the segment. A truly crazy-full load of extras on the S Q4, however, can bring the price up over $95,000. With Maserati throwing almost all it has into the Ghibli but the kitchen sink, the option-list heavy Germans (Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class) are able to have lower MSRPs by up to $15,000 before adding on the extras. The Japanese – like the Infiniti M range – likewise undercut the Italian. This would be fine if Maseratis had a tendency to hold onto more residual value over time than those competitors, but the market has routinely proven the contrary. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying.</p>

<p>The latest rumors emanating from the House of the Raging Bull say that Lamborghini is planning another million-dollar, ultra-exclusive supercar. Lambo is tipped to bring it to Pebble Beach next month, but it won&#8217;t be showing it to the general public.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has a proud recent history of turning its flagship supercars into something even more desirable. You&#8217;ll remember the Reventón that was based on the Murciélago previewed the Aventador and was offered in a limited run of 20 coupes and 15 roadsters with a seven-figure price tag. The Bolognese automaker followed up with the Veneno, an even more extreme take on the Aventador. Three coupes and nine roadsters were sold, with prices exceeding $4 million. (There was the Sesto Elemento, but that was a smaller 10-cylinder model.)</p>
<p>According to Motor Trend, this latest creation is expected to be based on the 12-cylinder Aventador, with more adventurous styling and likely a more powerful engine. You can bet it&#8217;ll be produced in small numbers and command a seven-figure price tag. Production is likely to take place at the company&#8217;s dedicated prototype development center that was opened three years ago.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s the point of bringing a new car to a public show if you&#8217;re not going to show it to the public, consider that the public isn&#8217;t the only ones that will be in attendance for the Monterey extravaganza. Some of Sant&#8217;Agata&#8217;s top clients will also be on hand, and it&#8217;s to those individuals that Lamborghini will be showing its latest creation. Lambo&#8217;s been known to hold private previews in the past, and cameras were not allowed the last time this writer was invited to such an event. But that concept was unveiled to the public at a major auto show the following month, so here&#8217;s hoping whatever Lamborghini is bringing to Pebble Beach will find its way onto the stage in Frankfurt come September as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been confirmed that the Lamborghini Aventador LP750-4 SV Roadster will debut at Pebble Beach next month during Monterey Car Week 2015.</p>
<p>The reveal of the new Italian supercar will come just a couple months after the marque’s president Stephan Winkelmann confirmed that an SV Roadster will join the coupe. The Aventador SV Roadster will be the first time Lamborghini has labelled a convertible as an SV variant.</p>
<p>Powertrain wise, the Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster will be the same as the standard coupe model. As a result, power from its 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine will be lifted from 690 hp to 740 hp. Additionally, 50 kg can be expected to be saved over the current Aventador Roadster. Consequently, the Aventador SV Roadster should reach 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds, the same as the coupe.</p>
<p>Visually, the Aventador SV Roadster is tipped to receive all the same visual and aerodynamic modifications as the coupe. Consequently, we will see updated front and rear bumpers, a new rear diffuser, matte carbon air intakes across the exterior, a large rear wing as well as specially-designed black wheels.</p>
