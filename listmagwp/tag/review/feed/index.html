				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli is the 3rd-generation of the model, but it&#8217;s been 17 years since the last one, and this new smaller Maserati comes only as a 4-door sedan. As with past Maseratis, the Ghibli is the clear sporting leader in this segment given its suspension settings and power delivery. The chassis architecture under the Ghibli sport sedan is also all-new and the drive performance is precise and enjoyable. For North America, the stylish Ghibli comes in two trims: the rear-drive Ghibli and the all-wheel-drive Ghibli S Q4. No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.</p>
<h4>Under the Hood:</h4>
<ul class="minus-gold-list">
<li>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (Ghibli for North America only)</li>
<li>345 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm</li>
<li>369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-5,000 rpm</li>
<li>EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing Notes:</h4>
<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli has a starting Manufacturer&#8217;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $67,000 for the rear-wheel-drive base model tuned specifically for North America to 345 horsepower. The top S Q4 all-wheel-drive version of the Maserati sedan starts near $77,000. Both trims come relatively loaded versus several of their competitors in the segment. A truly crazy-full load of extras on the S Q4, however, can bring the price up over $95,000. With Maserati throwing almost all it has into the Ghibli but the kitchen sink, the option-list heavy Germans (Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class) are able to have lower MSRPs by up to $15,000 before adding on the extras. The Japanese – like the Infiniti M range – likewise undercut the Italian. This would be fine if Maseratis had a tendency to hold onto more residual value over time than those competitors, but the market has routinely proven the contrary. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my full review of Apple&#8217;s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Can Apple&#8217;s iPhone 6 compete against the Google Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, HTC One M8, Galaxy S5, and the rest of the smartphone market? Apple Watch is arriving soon with compatibility for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and will definitely be a nice addition in terms of functionality. We also have NFC with the iPhone 6 &amp; 6 Plus that will be used with Apple Pay to make mobile payments.</p>
<h4>Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus specifications:</h4>
<ul class="minus-gold-list">
<li>4.7-inch display with a resolution of 1,334 x 750</li>
<li>dual-core Apple A8 chip clocked at 1.4GHz</li>
<li>1GB of RAM</li>
<li>1,810 mAh battery</li>
<li>up to 128GB of internal storage</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to the iPhone 6 Plus, it features the same internal specifications along with a larger 2,915 mAh battery, optical image stabilization on the rear camera, and a 5.5-inch 1080p display.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google today <a href="#">announced</a> IT admins can now apply policies to Chrome on Android and iOS, in addition to Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. This means they can, for example, use the Google admin console to set bookmarks through the Managed Bookmarks setting, set the <strong>Proxy policy</strong> or the Password Manager policy, across all six platforms at once. It’s important to note that Google warns this is an “experimental feature.” As a result, admins are told to inform their users before flipping the switch, as well as to report any issues via</p>
<p>In other words, enabling the new Mobile setting (Chrome Management needs to be turned on first) means that all supported policies (check the lightbulb beside each policy to see if it will on Android and iOS) will apply to Chrome on mobile devices. All users who are signed in to Chrome for mobile with their organization’s account will receive whatever user settings the administrator has set.</p>

<p>PayPal today announced partnerships with three leading Bitcoin payment processors: BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. The eBay-owned company wants to help digital goods merchants accept Bitcoin payments, although it is starting with those located in the US and Canada first (“We are considering expanding to other markets,” a PayPal spokesperson told TNW. “Stay tuned.”)</p>

<p>PayPal says it chose to integrate the third-party functionality directly in the PayPal Payments Hub because the aformentioned trio already offers its customers protections when dealing with the virtual currency. The company envisions anything that can be obtained digitally, such as video games and music, being sold in Bitcoin.</p>
<div id="attachment_158" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://anthemes.com/themes/kickcube/full4/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119.jpg" class='wp-img-bg-off' rel='mygallery'><img class="size-medium wp-image-158" src="http://anthemes.com/themes/kickcube/box/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119-300x200.jpg" alt="Image credit: Picjumbo Free Images" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://anthemes.com/themes/listmagwp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119-300x200.jpg 300w, http://anthemes.com/themes/listmagwp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119-768x512.jpg 768w, http://anthemes.com/themes/listmagwp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119-860x574.jpg 860w, http://anthemes.com/themes/listmagwp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SplitShire_IMG_6119.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: <a href="http://picjumbo.com/">Picjumbo Free Images</a></p></div>
<p><strong>This is important to emphasize, because PayPal isn’t adding Bitcoin as a currency to its own digital wallet. It also won’t be processing Bitcoing payments on its secure payments platform: everything is being handled by one of the three third-parties.</strong></p>
<p>Merchants who pre-sell products, meaning asking for money up-front for a product or service that will be delivered in the future, will also not be supported. This is, according to PayPal, to safeguard customers from businesses that can’t give refunds if they fold before the product is shipped and after buyer protection expires.</p>
<p>In other words, the company is starting to accept Bitcoin, but very slowly and very cautiously. PayPal Senior Director of Corporate Strategy Scott Ellison explains.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Google warns this is an “experimental feature.” As a result, admins are told to inform their users before flipping the switch, as well as to report any issues via In other words, <a href="#">enabling the new Mobile setting</a> (Chrome Management needs to be turned on first) means that all supported policies (check the lightbulb beside each policy to see if it will on Android and iOS) will apply to Chrome on mobile devices.</p>

<p>PayPal today announced partnerships with three leading Bitcoin payment processors: BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. The eBay-owned company wants to help digital goods merchants accept Bitcoin payments, although it is starting with those located in the US and Canada first (“We are considering expanding to other markets,” a PayPal spokesperson told TNW. “Stay tuned.”)</p>

<p>PayPal says it chose to integrate the third-party functionality directly in the PayPal Payments Hub because the aformentioned trio already offers its customers protections when dealing with the virtual currency. The company envisions anything that can be obtained digitally, such as video games and music, being sold in Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>This is important to emphasize, because PayPal isn’t adding Bitcoin as a currency to its own digital wallet. It also won’t be processing Bitcoing payments on its secure payments platform: everything is being handled by one of the three third-parties.</strong></p>
<p>Merchants who pre-sell products, meaning asking for money up-front for a product or service that will be delivered in the future, will also not be supported. This is, according to PayPal, to safeguard customers from businesses that can’t give refunds if they fold before the product is shipped and after buyer protection expires.</p>
<p>In other words, the company is starting to accept Bitcoin, but very slowly and very cautiously. PayPal Senior Director of Corporate Strategy Scott Ellison explains.</p>
