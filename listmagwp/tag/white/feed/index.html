				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I jump onboard Emilia Motors&#8217; incredible Mansory Vivere, a custom built Bugatti Veyron made by Mansory with price tag of about $2.5m! Based on the Bugatti Veyron, the Vivere is completely bespoke and limited to 2 units in the world. Aside the aesthetic modifications, the Vivere now produces 1100hp thanks to an ECU modification and finally the W16 engine sounds much better with a full titanium exhaust! In the video you will get to see and hear the car with a series of revs and onboard footages!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli is the 3rd-generation of the model, but it&#8217;s been 17 years since the last one, and this new smaller Maserati comes only as a 4-door sedan. As with past Maseratis, the Ghibli is the clear sporting leader in this segment given its suspension settings and power delivery. The chassis architecture under the Ghibli sport sedan is also all-new and the drive performance is precise and enjoyable. For North America, the stylish Ghibli comes in two trims: the rear-drive Ghibli and the all-wheel-drive Ghibli S Q4. No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.</p>
<h4>Under the Hood:</h4>
<ul class="minus-gold-list">
<li>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (Ghibli for North America only)</li>
<li>345 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm</li>
<li>369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-5,000 rpm</li>
<li>EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing Notes:</h4>
<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli has a starting Manufacturer&#8217;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $67,000 for the rear-wheel-drive base model tuned specifically for North America to 345 horsepower. The top S Q4 all-wheel-drive version of the Maserati sedan starts near $77,000. Both trims come relatively loaded versus several of their competitors in the segment. A truly crazy-full load of extras on the S Q4, however, can bring the price up over $95,000. With Maserati throwing almost all it has into the Ghibli but the kitchen sink, the option-list heavy Germans (Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class) are able to have lower MSRPs by up to $15,000 before adding on the extras. The Japanese – like the Infiniti M range – likewise undercut the Italian. This would be fine if Maseratis had a tendency to hold onto more residual value over time than those competitors, but the market has routinely proven the contrary. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying.</p>
