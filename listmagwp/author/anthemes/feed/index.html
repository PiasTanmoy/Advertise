<p>PayPal says it chose to integrate the third-party functionality directly in the PayPal Payments Hub because the aformentioned trio already offers its customers protections when dealing with the virtual currency. The company envisions anything that can be obtained digitally, such as video games and music, being sold in Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>This is important to emphasize, because PayPal isn’t adding Bitcoin as a currency to its own digital wallet. It also won’t be processing Bitcoing payments on its secure payments platform: everything is being handled by one of the three third-parties.</strong></p>
<p>Merchants who pre-sell products, meaning asking for money up-front for a product or service that will be delivered in the future, will also not be supported. This is, according to PayPal, to safeguard customers from businesses that can’t give refunds if they fold before the product is shipped and after buyer protection expires.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nomination package for the Production Design category in the 2015 Academy Awards, as part of a series of 20 different graphic title sequence packages for each category within the show.<br />
Commissioned by Show Producer Lee Lodge.</p>
<p>In The Sciences of the Artificial by polymath Herbert A. Simon the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. &#8220;Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design.</p>

<p>There are 4K Ultra HD TVs, and then there is Sony’s flagship 4K Ultra HD TV with four times the clarity of HD, more brilliant expanded color and up to 3x the brightness range of standard LED HDTVs. Breathtaking detail is depicted with pinpoint accuracy for the most natural images. The TRILUMINOS display produces the widest color spectrum we&#8217;ve ever offered in a TV. But what really sets this TV apart is Sony’s exclusive X-tended Dynamic Range PRO full array local dimming technology for up to 3x the brightness range. The range of peak brightness to the deepest of blacks is unlike any contrast Sony has ever offered in a TV. It&#8217;s quite simply the most immersive, highest resolution TV experience possible.</p>
<h4>Four Times Clearer Picture</h4>
<p>Four times the resolution of Full HD 1080p1. The 4K Ultra HD screen contains over 8 million individual pixels that transform everything you watch into a life-like experience. Advanced picture processing also ensures that every single pixel displays images with superb brightness and authentic detail.</p>

Based on the Bugatti Veyron, the Vivere is completely bespoke and limited to 2 units in the world. Aside the aesthetic modifications, the Vivere now produces 1100hp thanks to an ECU modification and finally the W16 engine sounds much better with a full titanium exhaust! In the video you will get to see and hear the car with a series of revs and onboard footages!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli is the 3rd-generation of the model, but it&#8217;s been 17 years since the last one, and this new smaller Maserati comes only as a 4-door sedan. As with past Maseratis, the Ghibli is the clear sporting leader in this segment given its suspension settings and power delivery. The chassis architecture under the Ghibli sport sedan is also all-new and the drive performance is precise and enjoyable. For North America, the stylish Ghibli comes in two trims: the rear-drive Ghibli and the all-wheel-drive Ghibli S Q4. No one really needs an Italian luxury sedan, what with all the good premium Japanese and Germans, but many desire one. And the 2015 Maserati Ghibli stands apart from the crowd.</p>
<h4>Under the Hood:</h4>
<ul class="minus-gold-list">
<li>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (Ghibli for North America only)</li>
<li>345 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm</li>
<li>369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-5,000 rpm</li>
<li>EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing Notes:</h4>
<p>The 2015 Maserati Ghibli has a starting Manufacturer&#8217;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $67,000 for the rear-wheel-drive base model tuned specifically for North America to 345 horsepower. The top S Q4 all-wheel-drive version of the Maserati sedan starts near $77,000. Both trims come relatively loaded versus several of their competitors in the segment. A truly crazy-full load of extras on the S Q4, however, can bring the price up over $95,000. With Maserati throwing almost all it has into the Ghibli but the kitchen sink, the option-list heavy Germans (Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class) are able to have lower MSRPs by up to $15,000 before adding on the extras. The Japanese – like the Infiniti M range – likewise undercut the Italian. This would be fine if Maseratis had a tendency to hold onto more residual value over time than those competitors, but the market has routinely proven the contrary. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying.</p>

<p>The latest rumors emanating from the House of the Raging Bull say that Lamborghini is planning another million-dollar, ultra-exclusive supercar. Lambo is tipped to bring it to Pebble Beach next month, but it won&#8217;t be showing it to the general public.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has a proud recent history of turning its flagship supercars into something even more desirable. You&#8217;ll remember the Reventón that was based on the Murciélago previewed the Aventador and was offered in a limited run of 20 coupes and 15 roadsters with a seven-figure price tag. The Bolognese automaker followed up with the Veneno, an even more extreme take on the Aventador. Three coupes and nine roadsters were sold, with prices exceeding $4 million. (There was the Sesto Elemento, but that was a smaller 10-cylinder model.)</p>
<p>According to Motor Trend, this latest creation is expected to be based on the 12-cylinder Aventador, with more adventurous styling and likely a more powerful engine. You can bet it&#8217;ll be produced in small numbers and command a seven-figure price tag. Production is likely to take place at the company&#8217;s dedicated prototype development center that was opened three years ago.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s the point of bringing a new car to a public show if you&#8217;re not going to show it to the public, consider that the public isn&#8217;t the only ones that will be in attendance for the Monterey extravaganza. Some of Sant&#8217;Agata&#8217;s top clients will also be on hand, and it&#8217;s to those individuals that Lamborghini will be showing its latest creation. Lambo&#8217;s been known to hold private previews in the past, and cameras were not allowed the last time this writer was invited to such an event. But that concept was unveiled to the public at a major auto show the following month, so here&#8217;s hoping whatever Lamborghini is bringing to Pebble Beach will find its way onto the stage in Frankfurt come September as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been confirmed that the Lamborghini Aventador LP750-4 SV Roadster will debut at Pebble Beach next month during Monterey Car Week 2015.</p>
<p>The reveal of the new Italian supercar will come just a couple months after the marque’s president Stephan Winkelmann confirmed that an SV Roadster will join the coupe. The Aventador SV Roadster will be the first time Lamborghini has labelled a convertible as an SV variant.</p>
<p>Powertrain wise, the Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster will be the same as the standard coupe model. As a result, power from its 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine will be lifted from 690 hp to 740 hp. Additionally, 50 kg can be expected to be saved over the current Aventador Roadster. Consequently, the Aventador SV Roadster should reach 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds, the same as the coupe.</p>
<p>Visually, the Aventador SV Roadster is tipped to receive all the same visual and aerodynamic modifications as the coupe. Consequently, we will see updated front and rear bumpers, a new rear diffuser, matte carbon air intakes across the exterior, a large rear wing as well as specially-designed black wheels.</p>
