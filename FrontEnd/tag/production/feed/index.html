				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nomination package for the Production Design category in the 2015 Academy Awards, as part of a series of 20 different graphic title sequence packages for each category within the show.<br />
Commissioned by Show Producer Lee Lodge.</p>
<p>In The Sciences of the Artificial by polymath Herbert A. Simon the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. &#8220;Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design.</p>
